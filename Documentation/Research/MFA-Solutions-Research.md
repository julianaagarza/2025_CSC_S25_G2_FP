# MFA Solution Comparison

## Objective  
This document compares several widely used MFA solutions, **Duo Security**, **Google Authenticator**, and **Microsoft Authenticator**, in terms of **features**, **security strength**, **usability**, and **implementation complexity**. These tools are commonly used in web and system authentication, including integrations with web apps like Flask or device-level protection in IoT environments.

## 1. MFA Solution Overview

### Duo Security  
Duo is a cloud-based multi-factor authentication service developed by Cisco. It supports multiple authentication options including **push notifications**, **TOTP codes**, and **biometrics**. It also provides **device health checks**, admin dashboards, **risk-based policies**, and logs for auditing.

- **Security:** Strong—supports secure push, TOTP, device posture checks, and adaptive MFA policies  
- **Usability:** Very user-friendly. Push notifications are fast, and the app is widely supported  
- **Integration:** Easily integrates with web applications using APIs, SDKs, and out-of-the-box modules (e.g., Flask, SSH, VPNs)  
- **Strengths:** Push-based MFA, central management portal, flexible policy creation  
- **Weaknesses:** Requires internet access for push and more complex API setup for smaller projects

### Google Authenticator  
Google Authenticator is a **TOTP-based MFA app** that runs on Android and iOS devices. It generates time-based codes every 30 seconds.

- **Security:** Good—codes are generated locally, so there’s no network transmission involved  
- **Usability:** Requires users to manually enter a 6-digit code during login; simple and reliable  
- **Integration:** Works with any system that supports TOTP, including Python/Flask apps via packages like `pyotp`  
- **Strengths:** Lightweight, secure, open standard, and doesn’t require a user account  
- **Weaknesses:** No centralized dashboard or logging; difficult to recover if the device is lost

### Microsoft Authenticator  
Microsoft Authenticator provides both **TOTP and push notifications**, and is designed to work especially well with Microsoft products.

- **Security:** Strong, especially in Microsoft ecosystems. Supports push, TOTP, and biometric authentication  
- **Usability:** Smooth user experience in Microsoft environments; simple approval process  
- **Integration:** Best for use with Azure and Office 365 environments; may require more effort for non-Microsoft apps  
- **Strengths:** App-lock, cloud backup, and biometric support  
- **Weaknesses:** Limited control and support when not used with Microsoft platforms

## 2. Pricing and Implementation Complexity Comparison

| MFA Solution         | Pricing (for basic use)      | Ease of Implementation             | Best Fit For                              |
|----------------------|------------------------------|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **Duo Security**     | Free up to 10 users; Paid tiers for enterprise features | Moderate (API setup + policy tuning) | Teams needing centralized control and logging |
| **Google Authenticator** | Free                          | Easy (just add TOTP secret key)     | Lightweight use with minimal overhead       |
| **Microsoft Authenticator** | Free                          | Moderate to high (Azure integration preferred) | Organizations using Microsoft services      |

## Group Decision

After comparing all options, our group decided to use **Google Authenticator** for our MFA implementation. Here’s why:

- Our system is built using **Flask**, and Google Authenticator integrates easily with **TOTP-based Python libraries** like `pyotp`, making implementation straightforward.
- Since this is a student project, we valued a **lightweight and simple solution** that doesn’t require setting up external services or managing a cloud dashboard.
- Google Authenticator is **offline-capable**, removing dependency on network connectivity or vendor APIs—ideal for testing in a virtual machine or isolated environment.
- While it lacks centralized management and push functionality, the simplicity makes it **easier to focus on the authentication flow itself** without added complexity.

For these reasons, Google Authenticator aligned best with our goals for ease of implementation, sufficient security, and suitability for an educational project environment.
