# MFA Solution Comparison

## Objective  
This document compares several widely used MFA solutions—**Duo Security**, **Google Authenticator**, and **Microsoft Authenticator**—in terms of **features**, **security strength**, **usability**, and **implementation complexity**. These tools are commonly used in web and system authentication, including integrations with web apps like Flask or device-level protection in IoT environments.

## 1. MFA Solution Overview

### Duo Security  
Duo is a cloud-based multi-factor authentication service developed by Cisco. It supports multiple authentication options including **push notifications**, **TOTP codes**, and **biometrics**. It also provides **device health checks**, admin dashboards, **risk-based policies**, and logs for auditing.

- **Security:** Strong—supports secure push, TOTP, device posture checks, and adaptive MFA policies  
- **Usability:** Very user-friendly. Push notifications are fast, and the app is widely supported  
- **Integration:** Easily integrates with web applications using APIs, SDKs, and out-of-the-box modules (e.g., Flask, SSH, VPNs)  
- **Strengths:** Push-based MFA, central management portal, flexible policy creation  
- **Weaknesses:** Internet connection required for push; may require more setup for custom apps

### Google Authenticator  
Google Authenticator is a **TOTP-based MFA app** that runs on Android and iOS devices. It generates time-based codes every 30 seconds.

- **Security:** Good—codes are generated locally, so there’s no data sent across the network  
- **Usability:** Requires the user to manually enter a 6-digit code during login. No push or biometric support  
- **Integration:** Can be used with any system that supports TOTP; very lightweight but lacks an API or admin portal  
- **Strengths:** Simple, offline-compatible, free  
- **Weaknesses:** No device management, user tracking, or centralized control

### Microsoft Authenticator  
Microsoft Authenticator is similar to Duo, offering both **TOTP and push notifications**. It is deeply integrated with Microsoft Azure and Office 365 products.

- **Security:** Strong, especially in Microsoft environments. Supports push, TOTP, and biometric-based access  
- **Usability:** Easy to use in Microsoft ecosystems; push approval is fast  
- **Integration:** Excellent with Microsoft products; more complex for non-Microsoft environments  
- **Strengths:** Biometric support, app-lock, backup to the cloud  
- **Weaknesses:** Limited flexibility outside the Microsoft ecosystem

## 2. Pricing and Implementation Complexity Comparison

| MFA Solution         | Pricing (for basic use)      | Ease of Implementation             | Best Fit For                              |
|----------------------|------------------------------|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **Duo Security**     | Free up to 10 users; Paid tiers for enterprise features | Moderate (API setup + policy tuning) | Teams needing centralized control and logging |
| **Google Authenticator** | Free                          | Easy (just add TOTP secret key)     | Lightweight use with minimal overhead       |
| **Microsoft Authenticator** | Free                          | Moderate to high (Azure integration preferred) | Organizations using Microsoft services      |

## Group Decision

After reviewing each option, our group decided to **use Duo Security** for our MFA implementation. Here’s why:

- **Duo supports both push-based and TOTP authentication**, offering more flexibility and stronger protection than Google Authenticator.
- It provides a **central management dashboard**, which allows us to **monitor authentication logs**, adjust security policies, and manage enrolled devices—features that are important for testing and evaluation in our project.
- While Google Authenticator is easier to set up, it lacks any form of administrative control or audit logging, which we considered essential.
- Microsoft Authenticator was a strong option, but since our project isn’t built within the Microsoft ecosystem (like Azure), integration would be more difficult.

We believe Duo offers the best balance of **security, control, and real-world applicability**, especially for testing MFA in environments like Flask applications or IoT access portals.
