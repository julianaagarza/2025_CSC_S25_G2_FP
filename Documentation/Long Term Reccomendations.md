# Recommendations for Long-Term Monitoring and Alerting

To ensure ongoing security of the IoT authentication system and support incident response and forensic analysis, the following long-term monitoring and alerting strategies are recommended:

---

## 1. Centralized Logging

- **Implement Log Aggregation Tools**: Use centralized platforms such as the ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana), Graylog, or Splunk to collect logs from all IoT endpoints, Raspberry Pi, and authentication events.
- **Normalize Log Formats**: Standardize log output across components to simplify parsing and improve visibility.

---

## 2. Log Retention Policies

- **Retention Periods**: Maintain logs for at least 90 days in active storage to meet common security and compliance requirements (e.g., NIST, PCI-DSS).
- **Long-Term Storage**: Archive logs beyond 90 days in secure, cost-effective cold storage solutions like AWS S3 Glacier or Azure Blob Storage.

---

## 3. Real-Time Alerting

- **Critical Event Alerts**: Set up real-time notifications for:
  - Multiple failed login attempts within a short period.
  - Access during off-hours or from suspicious IP ranges.
  - New/unrecognized devices attempting to connect.
- **Alerting Tools**: Utilize Prometheus with Alertmanager, Zabbix, or cloud-native tools like AWS CloudWatch for real-time alert delivery.

---

## 4. Baseline Behavior Monitoring

- **Establish Normal Activity Patterns**: Define expected login times, geographic login zones, and typical usage volumes.
- **Anomaly Detection**: Trigger alerts when behavior significantly deviates from the baseline to detect potential compromises.

---

## 5. Integration with SIEM Tools

- **Central Threat Correlation**: Forward logs and alerts to a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) platform for advanced analysis and threat correlation.
- **Recommended SIEMs**: Splunk Enterprise Security, Microsoft Sentinel, and IBM QRadar.

---

## 6. Alert Prioritization

- **Severity Levels**:
  - *Info* – Low-risk events, no immediate action.
  - *Warning* – Potential issues, requires review.
  - *Critical* – Likely threats, immediate action required.
- **Actionable Alerts**: Ensure each alert includes clear remediation guidance to reduce noise and support fast response.

---

## 7. Dashboards and Reporting

- **Live Monitoring**: Use visualization tools like Grafana or Kibana to monitor system health and event logs in real time.
- **Periodic Reports**: Generate weekly or monthly summaries of alerts, login trends, anomalies, and system usage for administrative review.

---

## 8. Regular Audit and Tuning

- **Quarterly Reviews**: Schedule routine audits of alert rules, log quality, and monitoring coverage.
- **Continuous Improvement**: Tune thresholds, remove stale alerts, and update detection logic based on new threat intelligence.

## Conclusion

Long-term monitoring and alerting are essential for maintaining a secure IoT environment. By implementing these practices, our team ensures timely threat detection, compliance readiness, and improved operational visibility. This approach reflects the best practices aligned with enterprise security standards and supports sustainable security management over time.
